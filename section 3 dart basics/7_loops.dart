/**
 * Loops helps us to execute code repeatedly 
 * Code is executed until an expression is fulfilled
 * Kinds:
 *  - While
 *      - Repeates the code block until a condition is fulfilled
 *      - Condition is a boolean expression as in the if statement
 *      - Used when it is not known how often a code block will be executed.
 *      - Can be executed zero to n times (head-controlled)
 *  - Do-while
 *      - Executes a code block until an expression is fulfilled
 *      - Code block is executed at least one time and checks the condition aftwards.
 *      - foot-controlled.
 *  - For
 *  - For each
